The company still used calls rather than the Internet, causing most customers to leave for the nation-wide chains, and was unable to adapt to an increasingly paperless world.<br><br><br> Ryan Howard, a new employee of Scranton Branch, predicted the company would be obsolete by 2017.<br> In 2007, Ryan Howard became Vice President of Sales and began a massive restructuring of the entire company, including a new website that would help make sales more efficient. However, his website was a failure (due to an ill-advised social networking feature) and he was later arrested for fraud when it was discovered that he was double-counting sales transactions into the website that were already made by salesmen over the phone.
